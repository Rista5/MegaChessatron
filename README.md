Chess engine for checkmate with two bishops

Version 2.6 capable of pushing black king into a corner but cannt finish the game.

Version 2.7 (working) the first version that is capable of finishing the game. The crutial thing was implementing the alphabeta alghoritam which enabled us to one level further in depth ( 7 ).
